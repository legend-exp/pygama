"""
The pygama signal processing framework is contained in the :mod:`.dsp`
submodule. This code is responsible for running a variety of discrete signal
processors on data, producing tier 2 (dsp) files from tier 1 (raw) files. The
main contents of this submodule are:

* :mod:`.processors`: A collection of Numba functions that perform individual
  DSP transforms and reductions on our data. Individual processors are held in
  the ``_processors`` directory, which is where contributors will write new
  processors for inclusion in the analysis. Available processors include all
  numpy ufuncs as well.
* :class:`.ProcessingChain`: A class that manages and efficiently runs a list
  of DSP processors
* :func:`.build_processing_chain`: A function that builds a :class:`.ProcessingChain`
  using LH5-formatted input and output files, and a JSON configuration file
* :func:`.build_dsp`: A function that runs :func:`.build_processing_chain` to build a
  :class:`.ProcessingChain` from a JSON config file and then processes an input
  file and writes into an output file, using the LH5 file format
