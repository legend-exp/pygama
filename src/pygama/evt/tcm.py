    """
    Create a time coincidence map (TCM), given a list of data tables from separate channels.
    Assume that all tables are from different channels in a SINGLE cycle file.
    Hopefully we won't need to extend this to event building across multiple cycles
    as in Majorana.
    - Sort events in DataFrames by strictly ascending timestamps
    - Group hits if the difference between times is less than `coin_window` (default length 4*us)
    - Don't allow events from the same channel into any event.
    - TODO: add a "t_offset" output column which is the time since the FIRST hit in the event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tb_list : list
        A list of N tables containing 'channel' & 'timestamp' columns.
    ts_unit : float (optional)
        Conversion factor for timestamps in native units to SECONDS.
    ch_col : str (optional)
        Name of the common column to use as 'channel'.  Default is 'channel'.
    ts_col : str (optional)
        Name of the common column to use as 'timestamp'.  Default is 'timestamp'.
    coin_window : float (optional)
        The default clustering time in seconds. (4e-6 sec is good for HPGe detectors)
        If events in other channels occur within the first window, extend the window
        by this amount and search again.
    data_cols : list (optional)
        Copy over additional columns (such as DSP parameters) when we sort events together
        by timestamps.  This is handy for event building DSP files with pandas, then
        optionally converting back to LH5 tables for file i/o.

    Returns
    -------
    tcm : DataFrame
        Return a table with NEW columns: ['ix_evt','ix_hit','tcm_sec','tcm_dt','idx_row_{ch}'].
        If data_cols is set, these columns will be added to the input tables,
        usually dsp data.
