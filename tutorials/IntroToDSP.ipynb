    "This notebook will provide a brief introduction to a few of LEGEND's bread and butter digital signal processing filters. These processors will be applied in sequence to digitized waveforms that are recorded to disk, and a brief explanation of why we use them is provided. The parameters of each processor may be varied as well in order to see the affects that they have. This goes along with C. Wiseman and I. Guinn's slides shown at the Early Career Showcase: https://indico.legend-exp.org/event/699/. Reccomended reading is Knoll chapter 17, which introduces many pulse-shaping concepts (although, from a hardware-perspective more than a digital signal processing perspective; even so, the concepts are similar).\n",

The goal of this transform is to return a waveform with a perfectly flat tail. The pole-zero correction assumes a simple electronics response characterized by a single RC constant (in this case 180 us). In reality, our electronics can be characterized by multiple RC constants; as a result we do not achieve a perfectly flat top, but by applying more complex transforms at this step we can improve things. The pole-zero applied here is close enough for most applications, though. Knoll chapter 17 sec 7B has a more complete description."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook has hopefully provided an informative introduction to some of the signal processing filters used by LEGEND to perform our analysis. The filters shown often have tradeoffs between reducing the impact of noise and preserving the information in the original waveform; for this reason, we typically optimize the input parameters of each processor. In addition, the parameters measured here require calibration to be physically meaningful. The slides in https://indico.legend-exp.org/event/699/ will introduce how each of these processes are done.\n",
