    "**\"Have you tried looking at the waveforms from those events?\"  - David Radford**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial demonstrating several ways to use the Waveform browser to examine data from LEGEND. This will consist of multiple examples, increasing in complexity, and will use data from the PGT. The waveform browser (pygama.dsp.WaveformBrowser) is a pygama utility for accessing waveforms from raw files in an interactive way, enabling you to access, draw, or even process waveforms. Some use cases for this utility include investigating a population of waveforms, and debugging waveform processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need a waveform browser when we can access data via pandas dataframes?\n",
    "Pandas dataframes work extremely well for reading tables of simple values from multiple HDF5 files. However, they are less optimal for waveforms. The reason for this is that they require holding all waveforms in memory at once. If we want to look at waveforms spread out across multiple files, this can potentially take up GBs of memory, which will cause problems! To get around this, we want to load only bits of the files into memory at a time and pull out only what we need. Since this is an inconvenient process, the WaveformBrowser will do this for you, while hiding the details as much as possible.\n",

    "## Contents:\n",
    "**Example 1:** Minimal usage of the waveform browser  \n",
    "**Example 2:** Draw waveforms using a data cut to investigate a population; fill a legend  \n",
    "**Example 3:** Draw waveforms from multiple populations with different cuts for comparison; using more advanced formatting options  \n",
    "**Example 4:** Draw processed waveforms from a DSP config file to inspect processors  \n",
    "**Example 5:** Access waveforms without drawing"
