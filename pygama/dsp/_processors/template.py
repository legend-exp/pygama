#
# Notes:
# - use `nopython=True` and `cache=True`         (@ian, is this correct?)
# - use 64-bit variables, e.g. int64 and float64 (@all, this is up for discussion)
# - use [:] for al output parameters             (@ian, is this correct?)

# 3) Define the processor interface
#
# Notes: (@all, this is up for discussion)
# - add the `_in`/`_out` suffix to the name of the input/output variables
# - use w_ for waveforms, t_ for indexes, a_ for amplitudes 
# - use underscore casing for the name of the processor and variables, e.g.
#   a_trap_energy_in or t_trigger_in
#

    # 4) Document the algorithm
    #
    """
    Add here a complete description of what the processor does, including the
    meaning of input and output variables
    """

    # 5) Initialize output parameters (@iann, will this be done automatically by the processing chain?)
    #
    # Notes:
    # - all output parameters should be initializes to a not-a-number. If a
    #   processor fails, its output parameters should have the default nan value
    # - use np.nan for both variables and arrays
    #
    w_out[:] = np.nan # use [:] for arrays
    t_out[0] = np.nan # use [0] for scalar parameters

    # 6) Check inputs. 
    #
    # There are two kinds of checks:
    # - NaN checks. A processor might depend on others, i.e. its input
    #   parameters are the output parameters of an other processors. When a
    #   processor fails, all processors depending on its output should not run.
    #   Thus, skip this processor if a NaN value is detected and return NaN
    #   output parameters to propagate the failure throughout the processing chain.
    # - in range checks. Check if indexes are within 0 and len(waveform),
    #   amplitudes are positive, etc. A failure of this check implies errors in
    #   the dsp json config file. Abort the analysis immediately.
    #
    if (np.isnan(w_in).any() or t_in == np.nan or a_in == np.nan):
        return

    if (not  0 <= t_in < len(w_in) or not a_in >= 0):
        pygama_abort();

    # 7) Algorithm
    # 
    # Loop over waveforms by using a `for i in range(.., .., ..)` instruction. 
    # Avoid loops based on a while condition which might lead to segfault. Avoid
    # also enumerate/ndenumerate to keep code as similar as possible among all
    # processors.
    #
    # Example of an algorithm to find the first index above t_in in which the
    # signal crossed the value a_in
    #
    for i in range(t_in, 1, 1):
        if( w_in[i] >= a_in and w_in[i-1] < a_in):
            t_out[0] = i
            return
