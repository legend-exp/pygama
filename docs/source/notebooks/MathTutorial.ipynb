    "#### An aside on the ordering of parameters: \n",
    "In the following the term \"shape parameter\" refers to a specific variable used to define a distribution that is not an overall scaling (which I call $\\mu$) or shifting (which I call $\\sigma$). An example of shape parameters would be the $\\beta, m$ parameters in a crystal ball function. The location and scale ($\\mu, \\sigma$) parameters have a more specific definition --- akin to what `scipy` does. If a $\\mu, \\sigma$ value is present, then the entire distribution is shifted and scaled; this can be achieved by transforming $y = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$ and computing $pdf(y)/\\sigma$ ( where the factor of $1/\\sigma$ comes from the Jacobian). \n",

    "Where `x_lo` and `x_hi` are the lower and upper bounds to evaluate a function on. These are particularly important when the support of a function depends on its fit range; distributions like uniform, linear, and step distributions are defined on a finite support and thus `x_lo` and `x_hi` are parameters that should be passed to *every* function call. \n",

    "\n",
    "`SumDists` works by adding two --- and only two --- distributions together. The first thing a user does in creating a new instance is define the order of elements in a `parameter_array`. Then, `sum_dists` works by grabbing elements at different indices in this `parameter_array` according to rules that the user provides in the instantiation. Here's how to write a generic class: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `parameter_index_array` that holds the indices of what will eventually come in the `parameter_array`. If the user will eventually pass `parameters = [frac1, mu, sigma]` then we just take `parameter_index_array=[frac1, mu, sigma]=range(3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `SumDists` takes an alternating pattern of distributions and distribution-specific parameter_index_arrays. Each par array can contain `[mu, sigma, shape]`. These par arrays are placed in a tuple with their distribution like `(dist1, [mu1, sigma1, shape1])`. Finally, a list of these tuples is fed to the constructor as `sum_dists([(dist1, [mu1, sigma1, shape1]), (dist2, [mu2, sigma2])])`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `SumDists` constructor then takes an array corresponding the index locations of where either fraction or area values will be passed in the ultimate `parameter_index_array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We pass one of the 4 flag options, to be described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We can optionally pass a list of parameter names, but these can also be calculated automatically if left as None\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace through how the code works for a simple example. Suppose we want to create the following distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "$new\\_pdf(x, \\mu, \\sigma, \\tau, frac_1) = frac_1\\cdot dist_1(x, \\mu, \\sigma, \\tau) + (1-frac1)\\cdot dist_2(x, \\mu, \\sigma)$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So... What is `SumDists` actually doing? \n",

    "\n",
    "`area1*frac1*dist1(x, mu, sigma, shape) + area2*frac2*dist_2(x, mu2, sigma2, shape2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "It computes this by first grabbing the relevant areas or fraction values from their position in the `parameter_index_array`. Then, at the time of method call, `SumDists` grabs the values from `parameter_index_array` that correspond to each distribution via slicing the `parameter_index_array` with the individual par arrays passed in the instantiation. In our example above, `SumDists` knows to grab the values at indices 0, 1, 2 for the first distribution because it is instantiated with the tuple `(dist1, [mu, sigma, tau])`.\n",

    "Because we are interested in fitting the areas, we send the `areas` keyword to `flag`. This causes `SumDists` to look for an `area_frac_idxs` array of length 2 in the instantiation: this array contains the indices that the area values will be located at in the `parameter_index_array`. The `areas` keyword causes the fractions to be set to `1`. \n",

    "In our example above for constructing $new\\_pdf(x, \\mu, \\sigma, \\tau, frac_1) = frac_1\\cdot dist_1(x, \\mu, \\sigma, \\tau) + (1-frac1)\\cdot dist_2(x, \\mu, \\sigma)$, the instantiation takes the `fracs` keyword. This causes `sum_dists` to look for an `area_frac_idxs` array of length 1 in the instantiation: this array contains the index that the fraction values will be located at in the `parameter_index_array`. `sum_dists` works by multiplying `frac` times the first distribution, and `1-frac` times the second distribution.\n",

    "The ultimate `parameter_index_array` that the user passes to the methods *should* look like `x_lo, x_hi, area/frac_1, mu, sigma, shapes1, area/frac2, mu2, sigma2, shapes2` based on which are present. For distributions with ill-defined support, such as a step or linear function, the user must always pass `x_lo, x_hi` for every method call such as `gauss_on_step.get_pdf`. If a sum_dists instance is created from distributions with well-defined support, then `sum_dist` *requires* that for `pdf_norm, cdf_norm, pdf_ext` that `x_lo, x_hi` are added at the front of the parameter index array; for ill-defined distributions it knows to look for `x_lo, x_hi` at the user specified location. This means that for `pdf_norm, cdf_norm, pdf_ext` the fit/normalization range is always set equal to the support range.\n"
