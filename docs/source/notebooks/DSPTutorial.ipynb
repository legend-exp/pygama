    "## Creating a simple processor with `numba.guvectorize`\n",
    "\n",
    "While ufuncs are powerful and can be combined to do lots of things, sometimes we want to break beyond the confines of the existing ufuncs and write more complex processors. For this, we use [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), which will convert your python code into C and just-in-time (JIT) compile it for improved performance. In particular, we will use [guvectorize](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/vectorize.html#the-guvectorize-decorator) to write [generalized ufuncs (gufuncs)](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/c-api/generalized-ufuncs.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "These gufuncs have the same advantageous properties that we outlined above for ufuncs, namely that they are vectorized, allow for broadcasting, and can operate in place. However, gufuncs have additional flexibility since they can be broadcast over arrays rather than just elements. In other words, they are not constrained to perform the same operation on each element of an array, and can instead be programmed to perform the same operation over sub-arrays. This is controlled by specifying the **signature** of the gufunc.\n",

    "### Let's walk through what that does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@guvectorize` \"decorates\" the python function we define, causing it to produce a JIT-compiled function instead of a normal python function\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```[\"(float32[:], float32, float32[:])\"]``` defines the the data types of the input arguments. In this case, we take an array of floats, a scalar float, and output an array of floats. Note that if the output is a scalar, we must still use the array notation `[:]` to ensure that the value can be changed in-place. Also note that multiple sets of inputs may be specified. (This is very similar to the C convention of passing pointers to variables/arrays so that we can change them inside of a function. Just replace the pointer symbol `*` with the array `[:]`!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```\"(n),()->(n)\"``` defines the \"signature\" of the function, which specifies the sub-arrays that we define our operation over. In this case, we supply a vector of length `n`, a scalar, and output a vector of length `n`. When we input arrays into our function, these are the right-most dimension, and it is important that the length of this dimension matches (i.e. `w_in` and `w_out` must have the same length). The function will implicitly broadcast over any additional dimensions (meaning we can supply arrays with >1 dimension). Type signatures can get more complex than this by employing additional characters to describe dimensions (e.g. matrix multiplication would look like ```(m,n),(n,p)->(m,p)```).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```nopython=True``` tells numba to use JIT-compilation to produce speedier code. Alternatively, we can supply ```forceobj=True``` to _not_ JIT-compile things and instead just vectorize python code. This can be useful for wrapping functions from other libraries, as we will see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```def polezero(w_in: np.ndarray, tau: float, w_out: np.ndarray):```: the definition of our function. This must have the same number of arguments as our signature and data types. The last argument `w_out` is our output. Note that the function can be run out-of-place by not supplying an argument, which will cause it to allocate and return a new array. The type annotations are not necessary, but are recommended for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```for i in range(1, len(w_in), 1)```: In the definition of our function, we use a loop. This is notable, because in base-python we ordinarily want to avoid loops for high-performance code. In this case, because numba is JIT-compiling C-code, however, this loop will perform very well.\n",

However, as noted above, it is not always necessary or desirable to do this; if a function is already vectorized, wrapping it can be redundant (this is actually the case for the above example).

ProcessingChain is an object that reads data from LH5 files, applies a sequence of processors, and then outputs the results into a new LH5 file. There are several advantages to using ProcessingChain:\n",
