The goal of this transform is to return a waveform with a perfectly flat tail. The pole-zero correction assumes a simple electronics response characterized by a single RC constant (in this case 180 microseconds). In reality, our electronics can be characterized by multiple RC constants; as a result we do not achieve a perfectly flat top, but by applying more complex transforms at this step we can improve things. The pole-zero applied here is close enough for most applications, though.\n",

The short rising edge has the advantage of preserving most timing information in the rising edge. The longer tail helps us correct for low frequency noise. Here, we use 0.1 / 1 / 3 microseconds as the rise / flat / fall times.\n",

While this reduces the impact of noise on our measurement, it also reduces the timing information in the rising edge, reducing the signal; as a result, we must find an optimal balance in our smoothing. Knoll chapter 17 Sec. 4 describes gaussian shaping.\n",
